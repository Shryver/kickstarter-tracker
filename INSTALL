to install, put the scripts in a directory.
put the web interface in another one.
edit the config.ini file in the web interface to tell
it where the scripts are.

once your server is running, ensure that the .ini files
are not served by your web server. (.htaccess for apache etc)

then, you just have to access http://youraddress:port/index.php
to begin using it.

note that the web interface is not done yet.
